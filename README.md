# Paciente-Student-Portfolio-for-COSC111

This portfolio showcases my learning journey and projects in **Internet of Things (IoT)**, where I explored the integration of **sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers** to create interactive systems.  

The learning process began with **simple Arduino projects**, such as basic LED control and running light sequences, and gradually advanced to **more complex applications**, including **sensor-based fire alarms, Python-Arduino integration, bi-directional communication, and web-controlled IoT systems using FastAPI**. Each project introduced new challenges and concepts, helping me strengthen both my **hardware and software skills**, as well as my understanding of **IoT system design**.  

All projects were completed in **collaborative group settings**, working with teams of **3, 5, and 6 members**, each presenting unique dynamics, problem-solving approaches, and learning opportunities. In total, this portfolio documents **9 completed projects**, demonstrating my growth from foundational IoT experiments to full-stack, interactive systems.

## 🔹 Laboratory Activities / Projects

- **Laboratory Activity #1 – Running Light Circuit**  
  Created a sequential LED “running light” using digital pins 8–12 on Arduino. Learned to control LEDs with `digitalWrite()` and implement timing with `delay()`. This project introduced **digital signals, circuit setup, and basic Arduino programming**.  

- **Laboratory Activity #2 – Working with Analog Signals: Fading LEDs**  
  Implemented smooth **LED fade-in and fade-out sequences** using **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)**. Explored **analog simulation with digital pins, nested loops, and dynamic control of brightness**.  

- **Laboratory Activity #3 – Fire Sensor Simulation**  
  Developed an automated **fire alarm system** using a thermistor and photoresistor. Applied **sensor calibration, thresholding, and conditional logic (AND gates)** to trigger a buzzer and LED only when temperature and brightness exceeded critical values.  

- **Laboratory Activity #4 – Arduino Serial Connection**  
  Implemented a **latching alarm system** with two-way **Serial communication**. Learned **string handling, state retention, and blocking loops**, enabling the system to remain in an alarm state until reset via the Serial Monitor.  

- **Laboratory Activity #5 – Python-Arduino Integration**  
  Integrated **Python as a remote control interface** for Arduino LEDs. Learned **cross-platform communication, CLI design, modular programming, and state management**, toggling LEDs in real-time through Python commands.  

- **Laboratory Activity #6 – Bi-Directional Serial Communication**  
  Created a **closed-loop system** where Arduino and Python exchange data in real-time. Implemented **edge detection, full-duplex communication, and modular code**, allowing physical button presses to trigger automated responses in the software and back to hardware.  

- **Laboratory Activity #7 – Web-Controlled IoT System with FastAPI**  
  Built a **web-based interface** to control Arduino LEDs. Learned **full-stack IoT architecture**, including **frontend JavaScript, backend FastAPI routes, middleware for Serial communication, asynchronous requests, and hardware control**.  

- **Midterm Laboratory Exam – Smart Light Monitoring System**  
  Implemented a **dual-mode light monitoring system** with automatic and manual modes. Applied **state machines, variable thresholding, command parsing, and real-time dashboards**, enabling users to monitor and control LED indicators based on ambient light.  

- **Final Laboratory Exam – IoT API Trigger**  
  Developed a **physical button triggering remote server actions**. Learned **gateway architecture, debounce handling, HTTP requests, and edge-to-cloud communication**, demonstrating how a simple hardware input can trigger complex networked operations.
